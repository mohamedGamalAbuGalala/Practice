--------------------------------------------------The Optimal Desire--------------------------------------

Let's check some Thinking paths.


--------------------------------------------------Remember?---------------------------------------------------

Adhocks vs techniques vs algorithms knowledge
	Remember make it 75:25 training for adhocks vs techniques vs algorithms knowledge
	And Approach much techniques before algorithms knowledge

PROBLEM needs: Understand Statement + Thinking + Idea + Verification  + Implemententation + Debugging

To be good, you must administrate the SKILL for each task

From hardest: Thinking - Verification - Implemententation - Debugging - Understand Statement

When facing a problem, it requires all the skills, each skill per a prolem is in one of 3 ZONES
		Zone 1 - The skill is mastered at this level of (Thinking, Implemententation, Debugging ....)
		Zone 2 - The skill is not enough with out little suffering and may be some hints - but finally manageable
		Zone 3 - The skill is so weak for such challenge right now 

To imporove your skills correctly, you need
	Displine:
		A systematic way to follow.
		That is you develop guidelines to follow, and evalaute/update for every problem
				
	Self Monitoring
		KEEP revising your stratigies in reading, thinking, coding. Your training plan.
		

You could practice many hours and has a slow progress!
	It is matter for quality not quantity!
	It is matter of smart work not hard work
	
Work smart not hard = Zone 2 + Self Monitor + Discipline	for EVERY solving phase

------------------------------------------------------Compilation-------------------------------------------------------------

We talked about Displine for reading, many thinkking tools, verification and implementation.
	In real contest we can't check all the notes! We need a summary!
	The most important displine is for order of the many tools! 
		E.g. should we think in problem simplifications first or problem domain re-interpretion? Develop your own.
		
	Let's put all in one summarized document!	
			
-------------------------------------------------------How to practise to achive the goal------------------------------------------------------------

Theoritically, when you face a problem, you should exhaust all your time till reach a "Stuck in thinking" State.
	In this state, you can't do anything at all any more!
	
	You shouldn't declare to yourslef a fake "I am stuck"! Stuck means Stuck!
	
	In other words, if you administrated lots of thinking algorithms and tools..you should try them all.
	
	After declaring "I am stuck", you should summarize all what you tried and WHY you couldn't make use of it. 
		E.g. I can't thing in problem reverse to try it!
		E.g. I can't model it as a divide and conquer problem!
		
	Then you start to get hint by hint from editoiral/coach..and see how this could help. If couldn't get more hints.
	
	Once you read whole whole solution and understood it, you do ask your self the most important Q on the earth!!!
		WHY I COULDN'T DO IT MY SELF?
			It is you fault!
				You did a mistake in calculations!
				You calcutaed order wrong and discarded problem!
				It is a divide and conquer but you did not think enough
				...
				
			Or because it is something out if your skills!
			
		If it is first one, you should see how to do better next time!
		Else, you should update your notes to manage it next time  
	
	
Practically, this could consume much much time! From time to time, try to just do subset of these to solve a problem.
	E.g. You may consider some algorithms? some thinking tools? You give each liek 5 min not more!
	E.g. Sometimes you read whole algorithm once, and sometimes you read it hint by hint.
	
	So you do all these steps, but differs from problem to problem!
	
Finally, even when we solve the problem, we should ASK ourselves, how to solve it much faster next time!
