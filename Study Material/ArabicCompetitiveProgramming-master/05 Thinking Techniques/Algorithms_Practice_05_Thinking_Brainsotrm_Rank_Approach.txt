 -------------------------------------------------- Thinking - Brainsotrm - Rank - Approach ---------------------------------------------------

In many times, contestants start to think in a problem, found an idea (e.g. let's make it by DP) and start to do "DIVING"
	By Diving I mean, keep trying to solve the problem based on an idea, but time passes with no output! 
		In other words, you are "STUCK in thinking"
	
		Sometimes, Idea is correct, but they don't study enough algorithms to know how to continue
		Sometimes, Idea is correct, but they don't do enough observations
		Sometimes, approach is correct (e.g. it is DP), but the idea itself is wrong (you need to think in other reccurance)
		Sometimes, approach is incorrect, and you need to think differently
		
		How to avoid stucking?
	
It is very important to BRAINSOTRM storm on different solutions that may work, before focusing on one way.
	E.g. Given ... Find the minium X? Think that DP, greedy, Min Cut, B & B or some adhock idea MAY do it.
		
	1- Try to RANK your guesses based on your analysis
	2- APPROACH the problem using most probable idea to do it (which may be wrong)
	3- Keep your eyes on TIME. When you start to tackle it this way?
	4- After little analysis, rethink about your ideas RANK. Is current approach still the best?
	
No idea is a bad idea
	Even if think idea is ridiculous, or will never work, give it a trial
	E.g. In many hard DPs one think this state is so big, we can't do it..and then 
		an observation appears! sparce space is possible! problem is doable!
