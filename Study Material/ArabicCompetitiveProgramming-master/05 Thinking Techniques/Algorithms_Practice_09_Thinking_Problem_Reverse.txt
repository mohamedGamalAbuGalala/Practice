 --------------------------------------------------Thinking - Problem Reverse ---------------------------------------

Problem Reverse is to think backward in the problem definition.

E.g. What is probability of event X occurs.
	Reverse: What is probability of event ~X. Answer is 1 - ~X. Sometimes Calculating ~X is extremely easier than X.

E.g. We have 2^N subset, find subset with property X (e.g. # 1s are 5).
	Reverse: Find subsets with property ~X (e.g. # 1s != 5). Answer = 2^N - Count ~X

E.g. Find Minimum Summation. (many times min/max are interchangeable)
	Reverse: Total - Maximum Summation

E.g. Given An "inc/decreasing" generating Sequence (Say Fibonacci), Given a value, what is its index in the sequence?
	Reverse: Given an index, could you get its value? If so, Binary Search on X tell finding vlaue index

Sometimes, problem is solvable through its main definition or reversed one.
Sometimes, the ONLY way to solve it is its reverse.
