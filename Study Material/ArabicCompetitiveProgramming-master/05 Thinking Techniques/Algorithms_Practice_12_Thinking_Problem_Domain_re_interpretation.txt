 --------------------------------------------------Thinking - Problem Domain re-interpretation---------------------------------------

A problem may have a domain: E.g. given N cities find a path from A to B?
	This problem lies in graph theory domain.

What if the cities are in Euclidean space? Then we have 2 involved domains: Graphical and Geometrical.

Sometimes, the solution requires you to re-interpret the problem in another domain. This is not always do-able, but may be the clue.

E.g. Say we have teams in ICPC competitions. Each team has strength (a, b). Team beat another if both a1 > a2 and b1 > b2.
	The problem solution in its internals requires knowing how many teams I could beat. This is doable in O(n^2). What if n so big?

	Could you reinterpret this problem domain? Yes, Geometricallly!
		Imagine plane where points are strength (a, b).
		Now, Team with (a, b) beats the teams in rectangle (a+1, b+1) - (MAX_A, MAX_B). Find fast way to count them FAST.

E.g. Given a sequence S of integers, and operation to minimize an item by 1, what is minimum operations applied to
	let this sequence convex (e.g. S[i-1] + S[i+1] >= 2 * S[i], for each i)

	Imagine plane where points are (idx, S[idx])...start to draw lines from ith point to....and do.... (don't care with details)


E.g. You are given set of states, each one is represented in terms of other sub-states, evaluate value for a given state.
	
	Let's reinterpret it Mathematically. Let each state is variable. Then we have N variables.
	Construct a matrix of the variables relations, Guassian Elimination is the solution .... (don't care with details)
	
E.g. Given set of boxes, each box has a key and is opened by certain key. Given a starting key, could you open all of them?
	Let's interpret it Graphically. Think in keys as graph nodes. We start from certain node(key). We move from key to another, by opening a box.
		Solution now is Eulerian Path.
		
	What about thinking in boxes as nodes, and form box to box an edge if it has its key. An extra source node for the starting key.
