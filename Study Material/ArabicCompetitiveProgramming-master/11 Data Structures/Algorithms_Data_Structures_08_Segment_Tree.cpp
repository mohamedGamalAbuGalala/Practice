/*
 * Segment tree data structure solves:
 * 		Given set of intervals (a-b). Then given set of queries, each query is a number, HOW many intervals contain the number?
 *
 * Segment tree ~= Interval Tree
 *
 * Interval tree data structure solves:
 * 		Given set of intervals (a-b). Then given set of queries, each query is an interval, HOW many intervals intersect the given interval?
 * 			If given interval has start = end, then it could solve what Segment tree
 *
 * Interval tree is extremely efficient in time/memory when moving to higher dimension
 *
 * Other related structures: range tree & fenwick(BIT) tree
 */























/* In fact, in programming competitions we typically work over a specific case of segment tree: The given intervals have start=end
 *
 * 		1) We assume we have a coordinate space on x-axis from [0 - N]
 * 		2) we are given set of numbers (order is not issue)	e.g.: 20 7 4 9 12		(actually, they are set of intervals [1-1], [7-7], ...)
 * 		3) Queries are as following
 * 			a) HOW many numbers are in given interval?
 * 				E.g In interval [1-3]  = 0	-> Notice, our first element is 4
 * 				E.g In interval [0-8]  = 2	-> 4, 7
 * 				E.g In interval [6-15] = 3	-> 7, 9, 12
 *
 *			b) Get Kth item in sorted list
 *				E.g. get(2) = 7		-> in sorted list 4 7 9 12 20
 *
 *			c) Remove kth item in sorted list
 *				E.g. remove(5) 		-> 4 7 9 12
 *
 *			b) Insert new element: so we update our list:
 *				E.g. insert(16)		-> 4 7 9 12 16 20
 */




























/*
 * The main point in these data structures is idea of PRE-PROCESSING before answering Queries.
 *
 * So how is segment tree constructed? Done as a BINARY tree, each item holds an interval, represents HOW many numbers are in this interval. Leaf nodes represents the main number.
 *
 * So to have N numbers as leaf, and want to go up layer by later till reach root as a binary tree, we need to go up logN level
 *
 * Assume we have N = 8, so above is 4, then 2, then 1. So a total number of nodes: 15 = 2^4 -1
 *
 * How to index them, given initial N values?
 * How to do the pre-processing?

/*
 * The tree could be used in many cases..don't limit ur mind for number of elements
 * 		Think for a while: could it represent accumulation of numbers in a given range?
 *
 *
 * Remember, this data structure allows following:
 * 		Allows for updating list of numbers with insert / delete NUMBER
 * 		Allows to get the position of a value
 * 		Allows to get the value of the kth position
 *
 * 		So it is Dynamic array vs the basic static array
 *
 *
 * 	Whenever problem needs subset of these features, consider segment tree
 *
 * 	Let's see an example
