### Exercises 21.3-2
***
Write a nonrecursive version of FIND-SET with path compression.

### `Answer`
[implementation](./uf.cpp)

### Exercises 21.3-3
***
Give a sequence of m MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, n of which are MAKE-SET operations, that takes Î©(m lg n) time when we use union by rank only.

### Exercises 21.3-4 *
***
Show that any sequence of m MAKE-SET, FIND-SET, and LINK operations, where all the LINK operations appear before any of the FIND-SET operations, takes only O(m) time if both path compression and union by rank are used. What happens in the same situation if only the path-compression heuristic is used?
