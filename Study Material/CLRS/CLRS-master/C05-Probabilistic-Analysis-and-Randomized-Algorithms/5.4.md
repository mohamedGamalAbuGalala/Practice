Suppose that balls are tossed into b bins. Each toss is independent, and each ball is equally likely to end up in any bin. What is the expected number of ball tosses before at least one of the bins contains two balls?

### `Answer`
This is a rewording of the Birthday Problem. The answer is the following:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? E\(B\) = 1 + \\sum_{k = 1}^{B} \\frac{B!}{\(B-k\)!B^k} )

check [Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-expected-number-of-ball-tosses-until-some-bin-contains-two-balls) and [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Average_number_of_people)
### Exercises 5.4-3
***
For the analysis of the birthday paradox, is it important that the birthdays be mutually independent, or is pairwise independence sufficient? Justify your answer.

### `Answer`
Pairwise independence is sufficient.

### Exercises 5.4-4
***
How many people should be invited to a party in order to make it likely that there are three people with the same birthday?

### `Answer`
If n=365 and k is the number of people at the party: 

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? E = C^3_k \\frac{1}{n^2} = 1 \\rightarrow k \\approx 94)


### Exercises 5.4-5
***
What is the probability that a k-string over a set of size n is actually a k-permutation? How does this question relate to the birthday paradox?

### `Answer`
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? P = 1\\cdot \\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n-2}{n} \\ldots \\ \\cdot \\frac{n-k+1}{n})

To be a k-permutation, there can be no repeated letters, so this is the birthday problem where k is the number of people and n is the number of days.

### Exercises 5.4-6
***
Suppose that n balls are tossed into n bins, where each toss is independent and the ball is equally likely to end up in any bin. What is the expected number of empty bins? What is the expected number of bins with exactly one ball?

### `Answer`

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Pr\\{X_i\\} \\quad\\text{is the probability that ith bin is empty} \\\\ P_r\\{X_i\\} = \(\\frac{n-1}{n}\)^n  = \(1-\\frac{1}{n}\)^n \\approx \\frac{1}{e} \\\\
E[X] = \\sum_{1}^{n}E[X_i] = \\frac{n}{e} \\\\
Pr\\{Y_i\\} \\quad\\text{is the probability that ith has one ball} \\\\
 P_r\\{Y_i\\} = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \(\\frac{n-1}{n}\)^{n-1} \\approx \\frac{1}{e} \\\\E[Y] = \\sum_{1}^{n}E[Y_i] = \\frac{n}{e} \\\\)


### Exercises 5.4-7

probability is less than 1/n that no streak longer than lg n-2 lg lg n consecutive heads occurs.
