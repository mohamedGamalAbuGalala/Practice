### Exercises 22.4-2
***
Give a linear-time algorithm that takes as input a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) and two vertices s and t, and returns the number of paths from s to t in G. For example, in the directed acyclic graph of Figure 22.8, there are exactly four paths from vertex p to vertex v: pov, por yv, posr yv, and psr yv. (Your algorithm only needs to count the paths, not list them.)

### `Answer`
Add a field to the vertex representation to hold an integer count. Initially, set vertex t’s count to 1 and other vertices’ count to 0. Start running DFS with s as the start vertex. When t is discovered, it should be immediately marked as finished (BLACK), without further processing starting from it. Subsequently, each time DFS finishes a vertex v, set v’s count to the sum of the counts of all vertices adjacent to v. When DFS finishes vertex s, stop and return the count computed for s.

### Exercises 22.4-3
***
Give an algorithm that determines whether or not a given undirected graph G = (V, E)
contains a cycle. Your algorithm should run in O(V) time, independent of |E|.


### `Answer`
An undirected graph is acyclic (i.e., a forest) iff a DFS yields no back edges.
Since back edges are those edges (u, v) connecting a vertex u to an ancestor
v in a depth-first tree, so no back edges means there are only tree edges, so
there is no cycle.

So we can simply run DFS. If find a back edge, there is a cycle. The complexity
is O(V ) instead of O(E + V ). Since if there is a back edge, it must
be found before seeing |V | distinct edges. This is because in a acyclic (undirected
) forest, |E| ≤ |V | - 1

### Exercises 22.4-4
***
Prove or disprove: If a directed graph G contains cycles, then TOPOLOGICAL-SORT (G) produces a vertex ordering that minimizes the number of "bad" edges that are inconsistent with the ordering produced.


### `Answer`

该结论是不成立的. 选择不同的起始点, 拓扑排序(按书上的深度优先遍历实现)会给出不同的序列, 不能保证坏边的数目最少.

先说明坏边的含义:

假设拓扑排序生成的结点序列为 a,b,c,d , 则对于该序列来说有向边 d -> a 为坏边, a -> d 不是.

考虑如下反例:

对于以下图 G:

            a
          /  ^\
         /    \\
        V      \V
       b ------> c 

若从 a 点开始, 得到序列 a, b, c, 则有 1 条坏边 c -> a

若从 b 点开始, 得到序列 b, c, a, 则有 2 条坏边 a -> c, a -> b

所以结论不成立

			
### Exercises 22.4-5
***
Another way to perform topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) is to repeatedly find a vertex of in-degree 0, output it, and remove it and all of its outgoing edges from the graph. Explain how to implement this idea so that it runs in time O(V + E). What happens to this algorithm if G has cycles?

### `Answer`
首先,运行DFS或者是BFS可以在O(V+E)的时间内统计出每个点的入度和出度,以后在删除边的时候要维护这些信息. 每次输出入度为0的那个点并删除其出边,并维护信息,因此有E条边和V个点,所以要执行O(V)次输出和O(E)次的删除.所以总的运行时间是O(V+E)

如果图有回路,那么有时候可能没有入度为0的点.
